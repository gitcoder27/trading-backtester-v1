## **Product Requirements Document: High-Performance Trading Backtester**

* **Version:** 2.0
* **Status:** Final
* **Author:** Ayan
* **Date:** 2025-08-24

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a complete front-end and back-end rewrite of the existing Python-based trading backtesting framework. The current Streamlit application will be replaced with a modern, decoupled web application using **FastAPI** for the back end and **React** for the front end. The primary goal is to create a professional-grade, high-performance platform for traders and quantitative analysts that offers a superior user experience and a scalable architecture for future growth.

#### **1.2. Goals and Objectives**

* **Exceptional Performance:** The application must deliver a snappy, responsive user experience, even with large datasets and computationally intensive backtests.
* **Modern and Intuitive UI/UX:** The new user interface will be clean, modern, and intuitive, with a strong focus on data visualization and ease of use.
* **Scalability and Maintainability:** The architecture must be designed for scalability and maintainability, allowing for the addition of new features and easy onboarding of new developers.
* **Robustness and Reliability:** The application must be reliable and produce accurate results, with a comprehensive test suite to ensure quality.

#### **1.3. Target Audience**

* **Retail Traders & Quants:** Individuals who need a powerful and flexible tool for backtesting and analyzing trading strategies.
* **Developers:** The project should be a pleasure to work on, with a clean, well-documented codebase that follows industry best practices.

***

### **2. High-Level Architecture**

The application will be architected as a decoupled front end and back end, communicating via a RESTful API.



#### **2.1. Back End (FastAPI)**

A **FastAPI** application will serve as the brain of the operation, handling all the heavy lifting.

* **Core Logic:** It will reuse and extend the existing, battle-tested backtesting engine from the `backtester` directory.
* **API:** It will expose a set of well-defined, RESTful API endpoints for the front end to consume.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** It will leverage FastAPI's native `async` support to handle long-running tasks like backtests without blocking the server.

#### **2.2. Front End (React)**

A single-page application (SPA) built with **React** will provide a rich, interactive user experience.

* **UI/UX:** It will be responsible for rendering the user interface and all data visualizations.
* **State Management:** It will use a modern state management library like **Redux Toolkit** to manage the application's state in a predictable and efficient manner.
* **API Communication:** It will use a library like **Axios** or **React Query** to communicate with the FastAPI back end.

### **3. Technical Implementation and Best Practices**

This section outlines the specific technical requirements and best practices that must be followed during development.

#### **3.1. Back-End (FastAPI)**

* **Asynchronous Endpoints:** All API endpoints that perform I/O operations (e.g., reading data files, database access) or run long-running computations must be implemented as `async` endpoints to avoid blocking the event loop.
* **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI's dependency injection system should be used to manage dependencies like database connections and settings.
* **Pydantic Models:** All API request and response bodies must be defined using Pydantic models for automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.
* **Caching:** A caching layer (e.g., using Redis) must be implemented to cache the results of frequently requested data and backtests.
* **Task Queues:** For computationally intensive backtests (e.g., those running on very large datasets), a task queue like **Celery** with a message broker like **Redis** or **RabbitMQ** must be used to offload the work to background workers. This will prevent long-running requests from timing out and improve the responsiveness of the API.
* **Optimized Data Handling:**
    * The existing use of `pandas` and `numba` for performance-critical calculations should be maintained and, where possible, extended.
    * For very large datasets, consider using a more memory-efficient data format like **Parquet** instead of CSV.
* **Code Structure:** The back-end code should be organized into logical modules (e.g., `api`, `core`, `services`, `db`) to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

#### **3.2. Front-End (React)**

* **TypeScript:** The entire front-end application must be written in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and improve developer productivity.
* **Functional Components and Hooks:** The application must be built using modern React features, including functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.). Class components should be avoided.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI should be broken down into small, reusable components, following the principles of atomic design.
* **Efficient State Management:** Use **Redux Toolkit** for managing global application state. For local component state, use React's built-in hooks.
* **Performance Optimization:**
    * **Code Splitting:** Use React's lazy loading and suspense features to split the application into smaller chunks, so users only download the code they need for the current view.
    * **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
    * **Virtualized Lists:** For displaying large lists of data (like the trade log), use a library like **react-window** or **react-virtualized** to render only the visible items.
* **High-Performance Charting:** The existing charting implementation appears to use Plotly. While this is a good starting point, for the highest performance with large datasets, consider using a specialized charting library like **Lightweight Charts™ by TradingView**, which is designed for financial data visualization and is already included in the project's `webapp/static/js` directory.

#### **3.3. General (Both Front-End and Back-End)**

* **Version Control:** All code must be managed in a **Git** repository, with a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
* **Code Quality:**
    * **Linting:** Use **ESLint** for the front end and **Ruff** or **Flake8** for the back end to enforce a consistent code style.
    * **Formatting:** Use **Prettier** for the front end and **Black** for the back end for automatic code formatting.
* **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** All critical business logic must have unit tests with a target of >80% code coverage. Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for the front end and **pytest** for the back end.
    * **Integration Tests:** Integration tests should be written to test the interaction between different components of the system.
    * **End-to-End Tests:** (Optional but recommended) Use a framework like **Cypress** or **Playwright** to write end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions.
* **CI/CD:** A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline must be set up using a platform like **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** to automate the testing and deployment of the application.

### **4. Detailed Feature Requirements**

*(This section remains the same as the previous version, as the feature requirements themselves haven't changed.)*

***

### **5. UI/UX Design**

*(This section remains the same as the previous version, with the addition of the following note on the charting library.)*

**Note on Charting Library:** As mentioned in the technical implementation section, the developer should prioritize using a high-performance charting library like **Lightweight Charts™ by TradingView** for the main candlestick chart to ensure a smooth user experience, even with large datasets.
